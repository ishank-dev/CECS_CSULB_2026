## Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

**Description**:  
Implemented a multi-layer neural network without using external deep learning libraries like PyTorch or Keras. The goal was to approximate the XOR function using a feed-forward network. Key steps included:
- Derivation and implementation of backpropagation formulas.
- Optimization using gradient descent.
- Visualization of loss over epochs and prediction outputs.

**Key Features**:
- Manual backpropagation implementation.
- Gradient descent optimization.
- Plotting loss vs. epochs.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

**Description**:  
Performed hyperparameter tuning for a neural network using various optimizers, including:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGD)
- AdaGrad
- RMSProp
- Adam

The MNIST dataset was used to train and validate the models, testing various combinations of learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters to find the best-performing configurations.

**Key Features**:
- Explored multiple optimizers.
- Plotted training and validation loss curves.
- Identified optimal hyperparameters for best test accuracy.

## Classification with CNN

**Description**:  
Designed and experimented with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in the CIFAR-100 dataset. The focus was on:
- Experimenting with activation functions, optimizers, and architectures.
- Dividing the dataset for training, validation, and testing.
- Benchmarking against other models on the CIFAR-100 leaderboard.

**Key Features**:
- Experimentation with model architectures.
- Benchmarking against the CIFAR-100 leaderboard.
- Comprehensive reporting of results.
